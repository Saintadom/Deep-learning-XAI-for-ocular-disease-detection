Preventable eye diseases affect almost a billion of individuals globally. Despite cliniciansâ€™ initiatives and 
efforts, avoidable blindness is on the rise (WHO, 2019). This experiment focused on developing effective 
deep learning (DL) models and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) using Gradient-weighted Class 
Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) technique and evaluating key drivers of XAI to enhance clinical adoption 
of DL models for ocular diseases diagnosis and swift decision making. This experiment produced outstanding results, while confirming the efficacy of pre
trained DL models for image classification. As a result, the Efficient-B4 model obtained accuraccy 0.9359, 0.9250 with corresponding F1-scores of 
0.8215 respectively. The Grad-CAM technique produced colour-coding visualisations of the important areas of the fundus image which may assist in ocular diseases diagnosis.
